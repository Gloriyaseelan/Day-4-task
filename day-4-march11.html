The sky is the panorama obtained from observing the universe from the Earth and other celestial bodies' surface. 
In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere.
 This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting.

Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km.
 It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. 
Earth is about eight light minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution.

Stars are huge celestial bodies made mostly of hydrogen and helium that produce light and heat from the churning nuclear forges inside their cores.
 Aside from our sun, the dots of light we see in the sky are all light-years from Earth.
